============ 

In plain English: 

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs, 
   please let us know!) 
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us. 
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a 
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that 
   you've used the IJG code. 

In legalese: 

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, 
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or 
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you, 
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy. 

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. 
All Rights Reserved except as specified below. 

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this 
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these 
conditions: 
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this 
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice 
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files 
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. 
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying 
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of 
the Independent JPEG Group". 
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts 
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept 
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind. 

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, 
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to 
acknowledge us. 

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name 
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from 
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's 
software". 

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of 
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are 
assumed by the product vendor. 


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, 
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. 
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead 
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, 
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file 
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part 
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than 
the foregoing paragraphs do. 

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. 
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. 
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, 
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright 
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable. 

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by 
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot 
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, 
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. 
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented 
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) 
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining 
code. 

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. 
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has 
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce 
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the 
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard 
GIF decoders. 

We are required to state that 
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of 
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of 
    CompuServe Incorporated."

Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement.  In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.    You may not 
 disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third party without Microsoft's prior written approval; 
 work around any technical limitations in the software; 
 reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;

4. DOCUMENTATION.  Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes. 
5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations.  You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting. 
6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it. 
7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services. 
8. APPLICABLE LAW. 
a. United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort. 
b. Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply. 
9. LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so. 
10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.   The software is licensed "as-is."  You bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.  To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. 
11. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.   You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages. 
This limitation applies to 
 anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and 
 claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

Notes 

This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231 

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". See the older formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site, such as the translating or annotating specifications.?
